# ELEC-2607-Switching-Circuits

**Learning Objective:**

This objective of this course is to introduce the student to the theory and tools required for designing
combinational/sequential digital logic circuits and synchronous/asynchronous finite state machines.

**Learning Outcomes:**

1. Define the binary system and 2’s complement representation
2. Apply operations such as addition and subtraction for binary numbers and 2’s complement notation
3. Comprehend the different theorems in Boolean algebra and apply them for logic functions
4. Design logic circuits implementing a Boolean expression
5. Define Karnaugh maps for Boolean functions and perform algorithmic reduction on them
6. Define combinational circuits such as exclusive-ORs, exclusive-NORs, (de)multiplexers and adders
7. Design programmable array logic (PAL) components to implement logic functions
8. Define sequential circuits such as latches and flip-flops
9. Design synchronous and asynchronous finite-state machines from functional specifications
10. Reduce number of states in finite-state machines
11. Define Mealy and Moore output circuits
12. Use Textronix logic board to design, construct and test digital circuits with a lab-partner
13. Use computer-aided tools in a lab-environment with a lab-partner to design, construct, simulate and
test digital circuits
14. Write lab-reports, answer essay-type questions using text, equations and numeric values for
assignments and examinations
